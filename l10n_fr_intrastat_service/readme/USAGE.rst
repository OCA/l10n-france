To use this module, you need to go to the menu Invoicing > Reports > Intrastat > DES and create a new DES. Then, click on the button *Generate lines from invoices* to automatically generate the lines of DES. After checking the lines that have been automatically generated, click on the button *Attach XML file* to create the XML file corresponding to the DES. Eventually, connect to your account on `pro.douane <https://pro.douane.gouv.fr/>`_ and upload the XML file.
