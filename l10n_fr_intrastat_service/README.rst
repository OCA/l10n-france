=========================================
Déclaration Européenne des Services (DES)
=========================================

This module adds support for the "Déclaration Européenne des Services" (DES) for France.

The DES declaration has been introduced on January 1st 2010 in France. All French companies must send this declaration each month to France's Customs administration if they sell services to other EU companies.

More information about the DES is available on this `official web page <http://www.douane.gouv.fr/articles/a10899-la-declaration-europeenne-de-services-des>`.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to go to the menu Accounting > Reporting > Legal Reports > Intrastat Reporting > Intrastat Service and create a new DES. Then, click on the button *Generate lines from invoices* to automatically generate the lines of DES. After checking the lines that have been automatically generated, click on the button *Attach XML file* to create the XML file corresponding to the DES. Eventually, connect to your account on `pro.douane <https://pro.douane.gouv.fr/>` and upload the DES XML file.
