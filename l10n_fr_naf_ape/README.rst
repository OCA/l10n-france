French NAF partner categories and APE code
==========================================
This module imports the French official NAF
nomenclature of partner activities as partner categories, as an extension to
the NACE categories of the European Union.

It will also add a field to the partner form, to enter the partner's APE
(official main activity of the company), picked among the NAF nomenclature.

Installation
============
Because the NAF is based on the NACE of the European Union, this module
depends on the categories provided by the module `l10n_eu_nace`.
To install this module, you may either:

* download it from the Odoo app store: https://www.odoo.com/apps?search=l10n_eu_nace
* OR download and install the code of the OCA project *Community data files*: https://github.com/OCA/community-data-files

Usage
=====
Each NAF code is represented by a partner category.
For convenience, the NAF can be entered either in the main partner "tag" fields, or in a dedicated field called "APE" on the partner form.
