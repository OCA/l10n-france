Opgaaf IntraCommunautaire Prestaties (ICP)

Based on Akretion's Intrastat framework, this module provides an
intrastat report for the Netherlands. Only generating the required data
for a manual declaration is supported. Message communication with the
tax authority has not yet been implemented.

The intrastat base module requires the country field required on
partner addresses. Selected countries are marked for inclusion in this report.

Amounts for products and services are reported separately. You can mark
products internally as 'Accessory costs'. Invoiced amounts for such 
products will be listed under the 'service amount'.

To exclude specific lines from the report, you can mark specific taxes
as such. If such a tax is applied to the line, the line will not be
included in the reported amounts
