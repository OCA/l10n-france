This module implements the France-specific part of the Factur-X standard to generate Factur-X invoices. In particular, it adds the SIRET of the buyer and the seller in the XML file embedded in the PDF invoice.

Factur-X is the e-invoicing standard for France and Germany. The Factur-X specifications are available on the website of `FNFE-MPE <http://fnfe-mpe.org/factur-x/>`_.

This module will be installed automatically when the modules *account_invoice_facturx* and *l10n_fr_siret* are installed.
