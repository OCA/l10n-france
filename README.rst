Account Balance EBP CSV export
==============================

This module adds a button *EBP csv File* next to the *Print* button on the Trial Balance wizard. It will export the Trial Balance in the CSV export format of the EBP accounting software.

One of the possible usage scenario of this module is to export the trial balance to software dedicated to the `Liasse fiscale <http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liasse_fiscale>`_ (French fiscal declaration) that accept CSV files from the EBP accounting software. This file has been successfully tested with the following software:

* `Teledec <https://www.teledec.fr/>`_, which is a SaaS solution for the
  *Liasse fiscale* with support for EDI transmission (Akretion France uses
  Teledec to tele-transmit via EDI its Liasse fiscale to the French tax administration).

* `Sage Etats Comptables et Fiscaux <http://www.sage.fr/fr/logiciels/comptabilite-fiscalite-finance/grandes-entreprises/sage-frp-etats-comptables-et-fiscaux>`, which is a Windows software to compute, edit and transmit via EDI the *Liasse fiscale* and other fiscal declarations. It can import the CSV balance generated by this module if you select *EBP WIN* as import filter.
