On the customer form view of a French public administration, in the *Accounting* tab, set the *Customer Invoice Transmission Method* to *Chorus Pro*. You will then see a new section *Chorus Pro*. In this section, you should set the *Info required for Chorus* and, if the administration is *Service required*, you must create the Chorus services.

If you enabled the Chorus API, just click on the button *Update Info Required for Chorus* and it will set the field *Info required for Chorus* and download all the Chorus services of that administration.

When you try to validate a customer invoice/refund for a customer for which you send the invoices via Chorus Pro, it will check the value of the field *Info required for Chorus* and check that this invoice has an order reference or/and a Chorus service if required for that customer.

If you enabled the Chorus API, you should see a button *Send to Chorus* on validated customer invoices and refunds that have a transmission method set to *Chorus Pro*. You can also select several customer invoices/refunds and do *Action > Send to Chorus Pro*.

Sending an invoice via the Chorus API creates a Chorus Flow, cf menu *Accounting > Configuration > Chorus Pro > Chorus Flows* (it is not really a configuration thing... so we could argue that it should not be in the configuration menu !). You can click on the button *Update Flow Status* to refresh the status of the flow, until it reaches the status *IN_INTEGRE*. Then, click on the button *Get Chorus Invoice Identifiers* to get the technical identifiers of the invoice in Chorus (and write it on the invoice in Odoo) and get the status of the invoice in Chorus. Eventually, on the invoice, you can click on the button *Update Chorus Invoice Status* to refresh the *Chorus Invoice Status*. All these actions to refresh the status of the Chorus flows and of the invoice are automated via the *Scheduled Action* named *Chorus Pro Invoice Status Update*. So, if that scheduled action is active, you should not have to manually perform the actions described in this paragraph.

In the list view of customer invoices, you can group by *Chorus Status*: that way, you get on overview of the status of all the invoices you sent to Chorus Pro, and you can easily spot if an invoice has been refused for example.
