On the customers that you invoice via Chorus, you must:

* enter their *SIRET* (*Accounting* tab),
* select *Chorus* as *Customer Invoice Transmission Method* (*Accounting* tab),
* select the *Info Required for Chorus* to the value that you obtained from Chorus (menu *Rechercher Structure Publique*),
* if the service code is a required information for that customer in Chorus, create an invoicing contact and enter the related *Chorus Service Code* and make sure that this contact is used as *Customer* on the invoice.

If you want to use the Chorus API to easily send invoices to Chorus from Odoo, you must:

* own a valid RGS 1 star SSL server client certificate generated by a company approved by LSTI (you can find the link to the *LSTI list* of qualified RGS certificate providers `here <https://www.lsti-certification.fr/index.php/fr/certification/psce>`_ on the LSTI website). Note that such a certificate costs about 250 â‚¬ per year.

* edit the Odoo server configuration file and add two keys *chorus_api_key* and *chorus_api_cert* that contain the file path to the private key and RGS certificate. Don't forget to restart the Odoo server after the update of its configuration file.

* in the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Settings*, in the section *Chorus API*, enable the option *Use Chorus API*, which will add all users to the *Chorus API* group. Then set the additional configuration parameters for Chorus API that will be prompted on the settings page.

In the menu *Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions*, you should also activate the scheduled actions *Chorus Status Update* and *Chorus API Expiry Reminder Email*.
