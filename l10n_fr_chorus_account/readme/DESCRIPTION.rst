This is the base module for the support of Chorus. Chorus specifications are available on `Chorus Pro Community website <https://communaute-chorus-pro.finances.gouv.fr/>`_. Chorus Pro is the electronic invoicing plateform of the French administration. All the suppliers of the French administration can send their invoices through Chorus and it is progressively becoming an obligation for all suppliers. To know more about Chorus and the obligation to send electronic invoices to the French administration, read `the dedicated page <https://www.economie.gouv.fr/entreprises/marches-publics-facture-electronique>`_ on the website of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

To be able to generate an electronic invoice for Chorus, you need the module *l10n_fr_chorus_ubl* (or other modules that support a specific e-invoice format).
