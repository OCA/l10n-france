===========================================
L10n France Certification - Abstract module
===========================================

This module extends the functionality of base module to feat with
the french Sapin law.

This 8.0 module is a backport of l10n_fr_certification of Odoo SA, made on Odoo
9.0 Community Edition.

Technical and Migration Note
============================

The 9.0 module has been backported, and refactored into two modules and a third
one is created for Point Of Sale.

1. l10n_fr_certification_abstract, that provide generic feature. (around sha1)
   to be used in extra other modules like l10n_fr_certification_pos.
   This module provides three new abstract models:

* certification.sequence.holder.mixin that creates on a defined model
  a new ir.sequence (type no_gap) if the model is associated to a french
  company.
* certification.model.mixin that provides functions to generate a hash
  for a certified model.
* certification.model.line.mixin that provides extra features to
  generate a hash.


2. l10n_fr_certification_account:

* account.move overloads certification.model.mixin model.
* account.move.line overloads certification.model.line.mixin model.
* res.company overloads certification.sequence.holder.mixin model.

3. l10n_fr_certification_pos:

* pos.order overloads certification.model.mixin model.
* pos.order.line overloads certification.model.line.mixin model.
* pos.config overloads certification.sequence.holder.mixin model.


When you'll migrate your database into 9.0+ version, the present module
could be replaced by the official one, and you could uninstall
l10n_fr_certification_account module. (and l10n_fr_certification_abstract,
if you don't use this module for PoS, or other future uses)
