This module adds a new field *Bill of Exchange Bank Account* on customer invoices to select the bank account of the customer that will be debited by the letter of exchange. This bank account must be a french IBAN.

If you configured the payment mode for **Accepted Letter of Change**, you will have a button *Print Bill of Exchange* on customer invoices to get the letter of change as PDF.

This module uses the standard workflow of debit orders as implemented in the OCA module **account_payment_order**. A debit order linked to a payment mode with the payment method *Lettre de change relev√©* has a few additionnal constraints:

* all payment lines must be in euro currency,
* the bank accounts on the payment lines must be french IBANs,
* if the payment order is configured with cash discount, you must configure the value date on the payment order (new field added by this module).
