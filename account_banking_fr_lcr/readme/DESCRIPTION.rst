This module adds support for French Letters of Change (in French:
*Lettre de Change Relev√©* aka LCR). This module supports direct LCR
(in French, *LCR Directe*) and not paper LCR.

This payment type is still in use in France and it is *not* replaced by SEPA
one-off Direct Debits.

With this module, you can generate an LCR CFONB file to send to your
bank. Then, your customer will be notified by their bank about the debit
(amount, date of debit). Eventually, the debit will take place at the
planned date.
