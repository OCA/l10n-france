This module requires 2 Python libs:

* `pypdf <https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/>`_ version 3.10 or above,
* `unidecode <https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/>`_ (any version).

In order to have the SIREN of the company and of the customer set in the CFONB file (optional field) and printed on the paper letter of exchange, the OCA module **l10n_fr_siret** must be installed. The installation of the module **l10n_fr_siret** is optional (because the SIREN field in the CFONB file is optional).
