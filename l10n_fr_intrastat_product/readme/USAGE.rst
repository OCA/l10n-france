To use this module, you need to go to the menu Invoicing > Reports > Intrastat > DEB and create a new DEB. Depending on your obligation levels, you may have to create 2 DEBs: one for export (Exp√©ditions) and one for import (Introductions). Then, click on the button *Generate lines from invoices* to automatically generate the lines of DEB. After checking the lines that have been automatically generated, click on the button *Attach XML file* to create the XML file corresponding to the DEB. Eventually, connect to your account on `pro.douane <https://pro.douane.gouv.fr/>`_ and upload the DEB XML file.
