To use this module, you need to go to the menu Invoicing > Reports > Intrastat > EMEBI and create a new EMEBI. Depending on your obligation levels, you may have to create 2 EMEBIs: one for departures (Exp√©ditions) and one for arrivals (Introductions). Then, click on the button *Generate lines from invoices* to automatically generate the computation lines of EMEBI. After checking the lines that have been automatically generated, click on the button *Confirm* to generate the declaration lines, create the XML file and set the declaration readonly. Eventually, connect to your account on `douane.gouv.fr <https://www.douane.gouv.fr/>`_ and upload the EMEBI XML file.
