Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

 * go to the menu Invoicing > Configuration > Intrastat > Transaction Types to create/verify the Transaction Types
 * go to the menu Invoicing > Settings and go to the *Intrastat* section

Make sure that you have already configured the other modules *intrastat_base* and *intrastat_product* on which this module depends.

WARNING: there are A LOT of settings for DEB and all these settings need to be configured properly to generate DEBs with Odoo.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to go to the menu Invoicing > Reports > Intrastat > DEB and create a new DEB. Depending on your obligation levels, you may have to create 2 DEBs: one for export (Expéditions) and one for import (Introductions). Then, click on the button *Generate lines from invoices* to automatically generate the lines of DEB. After checking the lines that have been automatically generated, click on the button *Attach XML file* to create the XML file corresponding to the DEB. Eventually, connect to your account on `pro.douane <https://pro.douane.gouv.fr/>`_ and upload the DEB XML file.
