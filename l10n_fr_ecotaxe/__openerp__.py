This is the module to manage the Ecotaxe for France in Odoo.
========================================================================

This module applies to companies based in France mainland. It doesn't apply to
companies based in the DOM-TOMs (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyane, RÃ©union, Mayotte).

This localisation module add a field "is Ecotaxe" on Tax object.
It add Ecotaxe amount on sale line, purchase line and invoice line.
The fileds Untaxed amount include Ecotaxe amount for readability.
In fact Ecotaxe amount are included in base of VAT.

To make easy ecotaxe management, ecotaxe are set on products.
So product contain ecotaxe values (fixed or weight based).
On the taxe "Ecotaxe" we use python code to get a right ecotaxe value from product.
One ecotaxe can be used for all products.
We recommend to use at least two ecotaxes :
1 for sale
2 for purchase

Adding ecotaxe on product category aims to facilitate ecotaxe setting.
