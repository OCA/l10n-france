This module adds some France-specific tuning for the wizard that imports
better zip entries from `Geonames <http://www.geonames.org/>`_. This
wizard is provided by the module base_location_geonames_import from the
project *partner-contact*. This module comes on top of
l10n_fr_base_location_geonames_import from the project *l10n-france*.
It moves the cedex to the cedex field added by the module l10_fr_cedex module
from the project *l10n-france*.
