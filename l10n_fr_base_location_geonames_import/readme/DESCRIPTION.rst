This module adds some France-specific tuning for the wizard that imports
better zip entries from `Geonames <http://www.geonames.org/>`_. This
wizard is provided by the module base_location_geonames_import from the
project *partner-contact*. This tuning aims at complying with
France's postal standards (cedex, arrondissement). It will
be applied for France and France-related territories.
