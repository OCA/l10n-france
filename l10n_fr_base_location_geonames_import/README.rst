French Localization - Base Location Geonames Import
===================================================

This module adds some France-specific tuning for the wizard that imports
better zip entries from `Geonames <http://www.geonames.org/>`_. This
wizard is provided by the module base_location_geonames_import from the
projet *partner-contact-management*. This tuning aims at complying with
France's postal standards published by *La Poste*. This tuning will
be applied for France and France-related territories where *La Poste*
postal standards apply.
