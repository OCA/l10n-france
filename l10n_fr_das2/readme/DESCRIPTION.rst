This module adds support for `DAS2 <https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/formulaire/das2/etat-des-honoraires-vacations-commissions-courtages-ristournes-et-jetons>_`, which is an annual fiscal declaration also called *DÃ©claration d'honoraires*. It will allow you to auto-generate the lines of DAS2 from the accounting entries, check the result, manually update lines if needed and eventually generate a declaration file. Then send the declaration file to the French tax office via your professional account on *impots.gouv.fr*

The specifications of the file are available on `this page <https://www.impots.gouv.fr/les-cahiers-des-charges-tdbilateral>`_.
