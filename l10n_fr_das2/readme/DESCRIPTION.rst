This module adds support for `DAS2 <https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/formulaire/das2/etat-des-honoraires-vacations-commissions-courtages-ristournes-et-jetons>_`, which is an annual fiscal declaration also called *Déclaration d'honoraires*. It will allow you to auto-generate the lines of DAS2 from the accounting entries, check the result, manually update lines if needed and eventually generate a declaration file. This declaration file can be uploaded on the dedicated website `https://teletd.impots.gouv.fr/teletd/connexionEFI.do <https://teletd.impots.gouv.fr/teletd/connexionEFI.do>`_; that way, you won't have to manually type the declaration.

The specifications of the file are available on `this page <https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/les-cahiers-des-charges-tdbilateral>`_ (select *Salaires, honoraires et actionnariat salarié*).
