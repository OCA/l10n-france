This module requires the Python lib `pyfrdas2 <https://pypi.org/project/pyfrdas2/>`_. As this lib contains the PGP encryption keys of the DGFiP used to encrypt the declaration file and as these keys are changed every year, check that the lib is up-to-date before using the module for a new year.

To install this lib, run:

.. code::

  pip3 install --upgrade pyfrdas2
