On the supplier form view, in the *Accounting* tab, you will see a section *DAS2*. For the suppliers that must be declared in DAS2, you must set:

* the DAS2 Type,
* the job for the DAS2 declaration,
* their SIRET number (for French suppliers only),
* their full address (street, zip code, city and country).

On the company configuration form, the APE code, SIRET and address must be set.

For the user responsible for the declaration, the phone number and email must be set on his related partner form (name, email and phone number are used in the DAS2 declaration file).
