Go to the menu *Accounting > Reports > French Statements > DAS2* and create a new DAS2 report.

Then click on the button *Generate Lines*. Check and edit the generated lines. You can get the details of the computation performed by Odoo in the *Note* fields of each line.

You should also have a look in the chatter: you may have a message that warn you about suppliers that have expenses recorded in accounts such as 622100 Commissions et courtages sur achats, 622200 Commissions et courtages sur ventes, 622600 Honoraires, 622800 Rémunérations d'intermédiaires divers, 653000 Jetons de présence, 651600 Droits d'auteur et de reproduction and are not configured for DAS2.

Once your declaration is OK, click on the button *Generate File* and download the generated file.

Connect to DAS2_declaration_, select *Transmission par internet des fichiers TD/bilatéral* and type your login and password (the credentials are specific to this website; their are not the same as on *impots.gouv.fr*). Then follow the online declaration process and upload the file generated by Odoo.

In the minutes following the upload of the file on the website of the administration, you will receive a first e-mail with a subject *ACCUSÉ DE DÉPÔT de 1er NIVEAU (Déclaration de salaires et/ou honoraires et/ou actionnariat salarié)*; it is just an acknowledgement, it doesn't mean that the file is valid.

Then, on the next open day (in my experience), you will receive a second email with a subject *Déclaration annuelle DADS BILATERALE. Référence DGFIP: xxxx. Numéro d'envoi : xxx. VALIDE*, which means that the file was considered as valid. If the subject ends with *BLOQUANT*, then you should look for the detailed report in the attached PDF report.
