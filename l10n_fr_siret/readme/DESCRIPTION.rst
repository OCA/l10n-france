The **l10n_fr** module from the official addons adds a *SIRET* field on partners, but it doesn't verify its validity. This module **l10n_fr_siret** adds several features:

* the validity of the SIRET is checked using its checksum.
* it adds **SIREN** and **NIC** fields (reminder: SIREN + NIC = SIRET). If you enter the SIRET, these 2 fields are automatically computed from SIRET.
* multi-site companies have a single SIREN and one SIRET per site i.e. one NIC per site. This module allows to enter a specific NIC on child partners.
* it adds a warning banner on the partner form view if another partner has the same SIREN.
