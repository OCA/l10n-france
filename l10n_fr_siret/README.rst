The **l10n_fr** module from the official addons adds a *SIRET* field on partners, but it doesn't verify its validity. This module **l10n_fr_siret** adds several features:

* the validity of the SIRET is checked using its checksum.
* it adds **SIREN** and **NIC** fields (reminder: SIREN + NIC = SIRET). If you enter the SIRET, these 2 fields are automatically computed from SIRET.
* multi-site companies have a single SIREN and one SIRET per site i.e. one NIC per site. This module allows to enter a specific NIC on child partners.
* it adds a warning banner on the partner form view if another partner has the same SIREN.

Usage
=====

On the Partner form, users will be able to enter:
* the SIREN and NIC numbers: the SIRET number will be computed automatically.
* the SIRET number: the SIREN and NIC will be computed automatically.

The last digits of the SIREN and NIC are control keys: Odoo will check their validity.

The warning banner is displayed on the partner form view if another partner:
- has the same SIREN,
- if the partner is attached to a specific company: is in the same company or is not attached to a specific company,
- if the partner is not attached to a specific company: is in any company or not attached to a specific company.
