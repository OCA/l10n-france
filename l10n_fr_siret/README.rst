This can help any company doing business with French companies
by letting users track the partners' unique identification
numbers from the official SIRENE registry in France: SIRET, SIREN and
NIC.

These numbers identify each company and their subsidiaries, and are
often required for administrative tasks.

Usage
=====

On the Partner form, users will be able to enter the SIREN
and NIC numbers, and the SIRET number will be calculated automatically.

The last digits of the SIREN and NIC are control keys:
Odoo will check their validity when partners are recorded.
