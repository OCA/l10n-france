=======================
L10n FR Chorus Factur-X
=======================

With this module, Odoo will be able to generate Factur-X invoices that comply with Chorus specifications available on `Chorus Pro Community website <https://communaute-chorus-pro.finances.gouv.fr/>`_. Chorus Pro is the electronic invoicing plateform of the French administration. All the suppliers of the French administration can send their invoices through Chorus and it is progressively becoming an obligation for all suppliers. To know more about Chorus and the obligation to send electronic invoices to the French administration, read `the dedicated page <https://www.economie.gouv.fr/entreprises/marches-publics-facture-electronique>`_ on the website of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Chorus Pro plans to start supporting the import of Factur-X invoices in 2018; so, for the moment, you should use the module *l10n_fr_chorus_ubl* instead.

Configuration
=============

Refer to the README of the module *l10n_fr_chorus_account*.

Usage
=====

In the menu *Accounting > Customers > Customer Invoices*, create an invoice for the French Administration. Validate the invoice. Then click on the *Print* button to get the Factur-X PDF invoice.

Then log into `Chorus Pro <https://chorus-pro.gouv.fr/>`_. Go to the menu *Factures émises > Dépôt factures* or, in the welcome screen *Accueil connecté*, in the section *Accès Rapide*, click on the button *Déposer une facture*. Then, in the pop-up, select:

1. *Format de dépôt*: *TO UPDATE WHEN AVAILABLE*
2. *Syntaxe*: *TO UPDATE WHEN AVAILABLE*
3. *Structure*: should display the name of your company.
4. *Choix du fichier à importer*: select the PDF invoice generated by Odoo.

and click on *Continuer*.

Once the invoice has been successfully uploaded, you should find the invoice in the menu *Factures émises > Rechercher* or in the menu *Factures émises > Tableau de bord* and you should be able to see the status of the invoice. If there is an error in the XML syntax, you will receive an email several hours after the upload with the details of the error (in my experience, it was 14h after the upload !).
